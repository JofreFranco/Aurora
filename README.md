# Aurora

This collection of codes helps to automate the analysis of multiple sine sweep measurements when using Aurora Acoustical Parameters with Audacity.

Since the convolution of Aurora in Audacity does not work properly when appying it to multiple files and room measurements usually have several audios, the convolver.py code automatically convolves several files in a folder with a inverse filter and save the room impulse responses obtained.
